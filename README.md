### Welcome to my Github ðŸ™‚

I am a software engineer and Makers Academy Graduate, with experience in `Node.js`, `JavaScript` and `Ruby on Rails`.

Solving problems through high quality code and learning new things each day is what I love about this industry. 

I follow a `TDD` and `BDD` approach in writing software, apply `OOD` and `SOLID` principles, and work to `Agile` processes and `XP` values.

You can find my Github CV in my pinned repositories. Please reach out if you are interested in my work and skills!
