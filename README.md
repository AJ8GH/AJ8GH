### Welcome to my Github ðŸ™‚

I am a software engineer and Makers Academy Graduate, with experience in Node.js, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.

I am committed to writing software using a TDD and BDD approach, following OOD and SOLID principles, and applying Agile processes and XP values.

Solving problems by writing high quality, clean code is what exictes me about this industry.
