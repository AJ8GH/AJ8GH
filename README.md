### Welcome to my Github ðŸ™‚

I am a software engineer and Makers Academy Graduate, with experience in `Node.js`, `JavaScript` and `Ruby on Rails`.

Solving problems through high quality code and learning new things each day is what I love about this industry. 

I follow a _TDD_ and _BDD_ approach in writing software, apply _OOD_ and _SOLID_ principles, and work to _Agile_ processes and _XP_ values.

You can find my Github CV in my pinned repositories. Please reach out if you are interested in my work and skills!
